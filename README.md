## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS


### What I learned

I've learned CSS and HTML before, so i thought it will be pretty easy but i have to admit i find difficulty to vertically center a div. I forgot that while using 
```css
.main{
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```
i should provide a valid height for the parent container. So, we learn everyday.

### Continued development

I need to improve my responsiveness and i encounter issues when i zoom-in up to 500% or zooming-out to 25% cause many elements went through their container and the design is no more suitable.


### Useful resources

- [Gemini] - This helped me for remember the need of the height of the parent element.
- [Devdocs.io] - When i had any doubt about a propert or his possible values, i use it to learn about it.
